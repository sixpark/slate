# Introduction

> The API base URL:


```
https://api.sixpark.com.au
```

Welcome to the Six Park API. You can use this API to access the Six Park API endpoints.

The Six Park API is a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)ful API and so URLs are resource-oriented. 
It returns [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) encoded responses and uses standard [HTTP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) and [OAuth2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) for authorisation/authentication.

We've provided language bindings in Shell but we recommend [Postman](https://www.postman.com). You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

### Version

The API specification version is what we refer to as the Draft V1 specification, therefore all endpoints will contain `/api/v1` in the URL path.

### Authentication

> To authenticate, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Access to the API is provided via [OAuth2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth). You must be pre-approved to use the API. You can request access by emailing [developers@sixpark.com.au](mailto:developers@sixpark.com.au?subject=API access).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```javascript
